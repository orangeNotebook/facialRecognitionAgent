# Facial Recognition - say what you see

This repo is part of my apprenticeship Artificial Intelligence module, it contains my facial recognition AI agent.

To run the program, simply download the `.html` file and run it! It should open a browser window and just work. All images in the image upload will work, however they might scale poorly so a size of 178 x 218 pixels is recommended.
